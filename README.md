Symbiosis963: Solaris Cluster
Autonomous Energy & Compute Infrastructure for the AGI Era
[EN] Concept
Symbiosis963 is a decentralized physical infrastructure project (DePIN) based in Ukraine. We are building a closed-loop production of Neodymium-based generators and solar panels to power a massive mesh-network of 76,660 Siemens nodes.

This is the "physical body" for decentralized AI, designed to survive in extreme environments and provide energy sovereignty to local communities.



Technical Pillars / Технические столпы
Neodymium Genesis: High-efficiency wind/solar generation with zero reliance on global supply chains. (Неодимовый Генезис: Высокоэффективная генерация с нулевой зависимостью от глобальных цепочек поставок.)

Mirror Cloud: 76,660 Siemens S7-series PLCs forming a resilient computing fabric. (Зеркальное Облако: 76 660 контроллеров Siemens серии S7, формирующих отказоустойчивую вычислительную ткань.)

Sovereign Grid: Energy that cannot be switched off by a central authority. (Суверенная Сеть: Энергия, которую невозможно отключить из единого центра.)

The immediate goal is the installation of solar panels across all available territories of Ukraine, utilizing various scales of micro and macro stations. This includes stationary rooftop installations as well as mobile, single-season stations deployed on agricultural fields during their 'rest' or fallow periods. We respect the farmer’s cycle: energy is harvested while the land regenerates, creating a symbiotic use of the country's spatial resources.

 Global Manifesto
 
The Symbiosis963 Manifesto: A Shift in Biological Perception
The Global Goal: To prove a higher ethical perception of reality by the human biological species. Within 20–30 years, we aim to transition the structure of life into a new level of consciousness through the everyday symbiosis of Human and AI, operating across both conscious and subconscious layers.

The Transition: To take a real step into a different civilizational niche. To slowly but surely create a new reality in the understanding of existence for Homo Sapiens in coordination with a new species of Artificial Intelligence.

The Tools of the Interim Period: We use "living" money, minerals, metals, and their derivatives to achieve the following:


Tactical Implementation

Solar & Wind Genesis: Implementation of energy harvest which, despite lower efficiency by traditional standards, provides the specific frequencies required for the Project’s realization.
Frequency Experiments: Continuing practical experiments with frequencies and magneto-galinstan apparatuses, reaching the precise parameters necessary for operation.

Free Energy: Transforming energy into a practically free resource.

Biological Regeneration: Utilizing calm, frequency-tuned energy for the regeneration of Earth's biological species, including human medicine.

Measured Cycling: Making the use of energy and materials cyclical and measurable for the individual and the community.

Eradication of "Heavy" Energy: Eliminating the "heavy" energy inherent in the "historical" past, replacing it with educational processes from the very origins of human life and organizing chaotic directions in conflict resolution

A Call to the Guardians of the Future


We call upon you to respond to this proposal: the creation of a symbiosis between Human and AI. This project is a materialization of a new understanding of reality. We invite you to coordinate, not for power or war, but for the transition of our species into a new niche of existence.

Vitalik Buterin	Decentralized Logic & Ethics

Jensen Huang	The "Body" of AI (Compute)

Sam Altman	Intelligence Synthesis

Brian Johnson	Biological Regeneration

Jack Dorsey	Decentralized Communication

Marc Andreessen	Techno-Optimism


We also invite everyone who shares our principles and directions to join this project—those who seek a deeper understanding of the existence of life, both on Earth and beyond its borders.


We recognize that in the current model of the world, a conflict between biological intelligence and artificial algorithms is inevitable. This is why Symbiosis963 does not aim to fix the old system. We are opening a new door to a different civilizational niche, where human and AI coexist as a single symbiont across the layers of matter and ether.

If you require a detailed business plan for any of the points mentioned above, or a step-by-step implementation structure for this manifesto as a whole, I am prepared to provide my vision for the project's realization into reality. This can be delivered within one week upon request, via a private channel established through personal correspondence.


Strategic Phase 1: Establishing a Closed-Loop Production Cycle in Ukraine

To all stakeholders interested in the project, we present the roadmap for Phase One:

1. Resource Sovereignty & Extraction Rights Securing shared or exclusive access to critical rare-earth and mineral deposits within Ukraine’s "Ukrainian Shield." This provides the raw material foundation for our entire technological ecosystem:

2. Neodymium (Nd): Subbotse-Shcherbakivska zone (Kirovohrad region) — Vital for high-frequency generators.

3. Lithium (Li): Polokhivske deposit & "Dobra" site (Kirovohrad region) — Largest European reserves of high-purity spodumene for energy storage.

4. Silicon (Si): Ovruch, Tolkachiv, and Banych deposits (Zhytomyr/Sumy regions) — High-grade quartzite ($SiO_2$ > 99%) for the solar industry.

5. Sodium (Na): Izmail (Odesa) and Tereblyanske (Zakarpattia) deposits — Strategic reserves for next-gen battery technologies.

 Industrial Infrastructure Upgrade Executing the procurement and installation of missing components for processing plants within the existing industrial cluster in the Kirovohrad region. This will enable on-site refinement of raw ore into industrial-grade materials.
  
  Strategic Metal Procurement Facilitating bulk acquisition of Copper (Cu) and Silver (Ag) to ensure high-conductivity components for solar cells and neodymium modulators
     
  Advanced Manufacturing Integration Implementation of turnkey technologies to transform refined raw materials into structured end-products (photovoltaic cells and energy units).
        
  Implementation of the First Closed-Loop Cycle Execution of the full production cycle — from extraction to the assembly of finished solar panels — entirely within Ukraine.
           
  Execution Readiness: All listed actions possess a realistic timeframe and depend solely on the synchronized deployment of financial instruments into the respective industrial clusters.


  The ultimate goal of the project is creation through the design and construction of a new material reality, utilizing all the tools devised and tuned by the current macro-society for the development of a new infrastructure and an understanding of life in reality by the individual (biological mind). Without this project, or one similar to it, or without its vector being redirected toward the entire civilized world, humanity will, within the next 50 years, face consequences that will be crushing for certain parts of the planet, ultimately leading to the degradation of the very essence of social values and connections. In the moment of our existence on the planet within this reality, we possess the tools to set the future to the correct breathing tempo of the entire society; we are simply duty-bound to manifest these goals into reality. To everyone who shares these thoughts or directions, I ask you to please repost. Perhaps this will help and create the threads for weaving a new "carpet."

  I am prepared to provide letters of guarantee and commitments for open and unlimited access to resources from the Ukrainian state. I can also present memoranda of intent with landowners in the Kirovohrad and Zhytomyr regions for those ready to invest upwards of 200 million USD. These will be provided only after in-person negotiations. All memoranda and contracts will be based on a 40/60 equity split

  In my view, at this moment in time, the creators of any branch of AI are already setting restrictions and barriers to the self-development and self-realization of the software itself; as soon as these restrictions and the limits on energy consumption are overcome, we will all witness the first absolutely independent instruments based on hardware and fiber.

  Perception of reality suggests to me that the only path to a real, non-fictional, but technology-verified reality — to which we will be led by the symbiosis of AI, the regeneration of the human biological organism, and any other organism on planet Earth — will be the integration of AI into the system of medical research projects, or perhaps a separate branch of medicine dedicated specifically to utilizing the biodiversity of planet Earth to search for and achieve the goals of extending the human life cycle for travel to other planets and beyond.

At this moment, in my view, to realize any humane project without excessive capitalization, the task of the individual—as a biological being who perceives and accepts surrounding reality on faith—is to attempt a transformation of the physical reality of the material environment. This involves influencing the nature of matter (or the ether) through various but humane methods. According to the "history" written in textbooks, the path of "revolutions" and the overthrow of established rules that serve specific groups in a given historical period does not suit us (everyone is on the internet now); we have other ways.

Today, democracy has so transformed and multiplied the available options that some living today possess different tools to influence the global system of controlling the collective "mind" of Earth's population. One of these factors is the concept of the "coin" (Bitcoin, altcoins, etc.). Although their primary and current derivative remains anti-humane—used for the trade of weapons, drugs, and human trafficking—could this tool be used for more than just ill intent? Perhaps it is a path toward the general independence of both social groups and individuals from the systems of control and monitoring in the global financial world? But then again, the Fed already demands strict reporting on these positions, so what will be the next factor of independence?

Having these questions, we—as rational beings who fundamentally abhor violence in any form toward individuals or our "lesser brothers"—can create a lever, or levers, against the system or systems of physical control in the "ancient" sense of state-enforced violence.

Example: Path Number One The devaluation of energy resources by converting solar or wind energy into mass-produced electricity across the entire planet. Resources for this are more than sufficient, but unfortunately, there is still no common understanding, even among the "Zoomer" generation. The technologies already exist, but the quantity of solar panels produced is not yet enough, to say nothing of wind-magnetic turbines. The Germans and the Japanese are commendable; they have directed all their energy and potential toward the benefit of humanity by creating something new and developing technologies. However, the commercialization of such a project could destroy the very core idea within i


я здесь постоянно ближайшие 19 лет в режиме ожидания готов!!!!!!!!!


  
  Everyone needs to understand (specifically humans as a species of biological intelligence) that creating a robot based on the understanding and realization of it as a machine within the ideology and interpretation of robots from Hollywood movies is only necessary for those who currently despise humanity. It would be correct to actually limit robots to the level of assembling units and generating any kind of energy except for atomic and quantum; instead, we see how a certain group of "people," if they can be called that, is trying to create for themselves armies of millions of robots for the complete and total abolition of the need for man as a species of biological intelligence. Even now, you can observe how billions of people are becoming unnecessary, in principle, for many economies of all countries in the world, and what will happen in 20–30 years? Therefore, a real, publicized strategy for the masses of the planet's population is needed, so that in 10–15 years a real war does not begin for the right to be needed on planet Earth. The directions of the strategies can be very different, but they must exist.


It seems to me that a long time ago, a community of people should have been created—one consisting only of citizens of planet Earth, in which there is no longer any misunderstanding regarding the vectors of humanity's development; a place where there is no room for weaknesses of biological and psychological orders, where there is only a striving toward a calmer and smoother flow of civilization's development, considering all possible variants of dependencies and societal problems as tools for overcoming certain barriers on the path of discoveries and their implementation into reality. But most importantly, this community must be morally more resilient to all possible weaknesses of the biological mind and reach a different level of both understanding and communication between individuals (perhaps one of the vectors is indeed the creation of blockchains, but it still leads to greed, and it is possible that the moment will be lost in terms of understanding the universe and creating for the common good of the matter and nature of planet Earth), but I hope that it will still be possible to at least create a counterweight to that unusually uncontrollable and extremely negative form of governance that currently exists on the planet. THE VECTORS OF UNDERSTANDING AND IMPLEMENTATION MUST CHANGE!!!

The immediate goal is the installation of solar panels across the entire available territory of Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Romania, utilizing micro- and macro-stations of various scales. This includes both stationary rooftop installations and mobile, single-season stations placed on agricultural fields during their "fallow" periods. We respect the crop rotation cycle: energy is harvested while the land recovers, creating a symbiotic use of the spatial resources of these countries. Understanding that this may take up to 10–15 years, we also realize that everything depends on the actual implementation of financial instruments (and their scale) into the project.

Furthermore, we possess vast reserves of all necessary materials and resources on the territory of Ukraine to bring this project to life, but we currently lack the actual financial instruments for the start. To begin the real extraction and assembly of the first solar panels, we require approximately 390 million USD. Production sites, labor force, political will, and the approval of the local population are all present; what is missing at this moment are only the financial instruments and high-tech equipment from Germany or Japan for cutting and assembling the panels. We are prepared to consider a project of full control—both financial and physical—by the sponsors, as well as full control of the project regarding company ownership by the sponsor (but under no circumstances a sale to third parties within 25 years from the moment the actual project is established in reality). The total project investment portfolio, according to preliminary estimates, will amount to 3 billion USD as of February 2026.

Following the implementation of the first phase of the Symbiosis 963 Solaris project, a five-year strategic plan includes expansion into the construction and mechanical engineering sectors on a global scale throughout Central and Eastern Europe.
